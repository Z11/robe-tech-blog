Background: Me and my girlfriend wanted to start a Photo Bus business and we needed a website. We first were looking around on different website builders like square space and wix, but they all charged $10-$30 dollars a month for a simple website. I convinced her that I could build a fast website with ZERO monthly costs. She agreed and I began my journey using GatsbyJS.

Why did I choose GatsbyJS ? This framework was often spoken at my job and on twitter. I would always hear "fast performance", "great SEO", "beautiful documentation", and "amazing developer experience". So many people are saying good things about it then i figured it must be good.

I first decided to read their documentation and i must say they made their documentation 

The main idea of GatsbyJS
